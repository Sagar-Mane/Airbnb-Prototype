>Airbnb is an online marketplace that enables people to list, find, then rent vacation homes for a processing fee. It has over 2,000,000 listings in 34,000 cities and 191 countries. Founded in August 2008 and headquartered in San Francisco California.
Airbnb is a peer-to-peer accommodation market place that connects hosts (vendors of accommodations) and travelers via its website. Airbnb enables transactions between these two entities by charging a 'service fee' without directly owning any rooms by itself.

**Airbnb-Prototype provides all the core features of [Airbnb](www.airbnb.com) and one extra feature of auctioning for properties .**
